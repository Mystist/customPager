## customPager

`customPager` is a jQuery pager plugin.

You can pager your html in two ways:  

1. Pager it in the front end.  
That means you need to get all the data from server first. And then everything is ok.

2. Pager it in the server end.  
That means everytime you do the page action, you need to get the filterd data from server.  
To do so, you need to provide a request function(just like `getDataFromServer` in the demo) and use the `fetch` option.

See it in the demo.
